AI-based self assessment: Idea and discussion<!--more-->

It was about 10 pm on the lobby of Up Peak (formerly HA-KA) hotel [^maps_2024a], when the discussion begin, where the preceeding was on Lumpia Mbak Lien [^maps_2024b]. The last was with the 2nd, and the first was with the 1st and 2nd of DAMARS [^ig_2024]. The 3rd is still in Bandung.


## accreditation
It is cycle of dumbness, if we can say that, if we already know that a process is not efficient and there are some solution for it, but we keep on repeating the process as is without any modification. I have sort of feeling about the accreditation process as a person belongs to the institution being accredited. It is my opinion, and only a few peole agree with it, but perhaps not all.

And surprisingly, AI assitance can provide information to support the situation, but with more polite way in responding to the rough question [^gpt4o_2024].

Its register some factors causing the ineffiency and also some potential solutions as in the following table, where each columns do not correspond to each other.

Inefficiency factors | Potential solutions
:- | :-
Bureaucracy | Digital transformation
Lack of modernization | Centralized data systems
Resistance to change | Continuous improvement
Redundancy | Feedback loops
Compliance over improvement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Training and support

And for the team assigned and left to handle the accreditation, it can employ following strategies

- document and highlight inefficiencies,
- develop a streamline process,
- leverage technology,
- build a case for change,
- engage stakeholders,
- perform training and development,
- open external collaboration,
- create long-term vision.

Those will make it is able to evolve even without institutional support, where the support might be triggered after the evolution results becomes pronounce, hopefully.


## steps
For now there are some steps cross my mind.

- Design the flow.
- Commuicate it with the 2nd and the 1st.
- Make audition with head of AI division for suggestion.
- Refine the flow with given suggestion.
- Repeat the process until sufficient document ready for implementation.
- Create team for implementation.
- Start to build the initial system.

Above steps can be change in the future based on given suggestions.
