Bundle 1 of res during week 29 in year 2024: New habit for reading<!--more-->

`15-jul-2024` The three first articles from Big Data Mining and Analytics [^liu_2018][^billert_2024][^alghamdi_2024] are informed by Ahmad Mushawir via WhatsApp, while last one from Physical Review Letters [^cerbus_2024] is informed by Francisco Martínez via ResearchGate with Gmail. Not yet read, just save them for, hopefully, this week reading materials. It means that they should be read :smile:. Addional info will be added later, when there is an opportunity.

`16-jul-2024` Informed from Andry Alamsyah in AIDI WhatsApp group about call of book chapter related to LLM on Springer Nature, which is traced back to ResearchGate [^mallick_2024], then ask Ridwan Sutriadi as mentor and informally agrees. He will be the first author and I will be the operator for interaction with LLM, e.g. GPT-4o from OpenAI, Gemini, formerly Bard, from Google, or Perplexity AI, where there might be anothers between us, which depends on the expert in the implementation field. And as preparation there is a list free AI and LLMs playgrounds [^awan_2023], event a chatbot arena [^chiang_2024].

Still at the same day, Edi Wahyu Sri Mulyono requests slide from I Made Wiryana on a DAMARS event [^wiryana_2024] and I also remember his slide from previous year, also a DAMARS event, actually the first one [^wiryana_2023]. Ask also for help about the book [^viridi_2023].

Another topic today is from ₩ Won in Soft Skill Trainers WAG, that sends slide about performing research with help of ChatGPT by Wisnu Jatmiko from Lab 1231 (IRoS) [^jatmiko_2024].

Above links are ordered according to interaction time, starting from the earliest to the latest. There are not any weights related to quality of interaction.
