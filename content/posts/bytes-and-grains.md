Bytes and grains: Create a Hugo-based blog hosted on GitHub<!--more-->

I just try to recreate my previous blog on GitHub and document the steps here. If you want the details how to create the blog from the beginning just jump to the last part of this story, where I put some blog article about it.


## the name
Well honestly, I struggle to obtain the name.

There are some blogs created previously, which also sourced from GitHub, but confused and undetermined names, e.g. [algo](https://github.com/dudung/algo), [blank](https://dudung.github.io/blank/), [blog](https://dudung.github.io/blog/), [bugs](https://dudung.github.io/bugs/), [bugx](https://dudung.github.io/bugx/), [bugx — on Vercel](https://bugx.vercel.app/), [butir](https://dudung.github.io/butir/), [einfachee-ideen](https://github.com/dudung/einfache-ideen), [eqnphys](https://github.com/dudung/eqnphys), [equation](https://github.com/dudung/equation), [expansion-model](https://github.com/dudung/expansion-model), [git-journal](https://github.com/dudung/git-journal), [idee](https://github.com/dudung/idee), [item](https://dudung.github.io/item/), [kuno](https://github.com/dudung/kuno), [lecture-notes](https://dudung.github.io/lecture-notes/), [moparc](https://github.com/dudung/moparc), [note](https://dudung.github.io/note/), [notes](https://github.com/dudung/notes), [nou](https://dudung.github.io/nou/), [o](https://dudung.github.io/o/), [odone](https://github.com/dudung/odone), [poem](https://github.com/dudung/poem), [ptext](https://dudung.github.io/ptext/), [s](https://dudung.github.io/s/), [slidex](https://github.com/dudung/slidex), [snippet](https://github.com/dudung/snippet), [soal](https://dudung.github.io/soal/), [teks](https://github.com/dudung/teks), [test](https://dudung.github.io/test/), [to](https://dudung.github.io/to/), [unegx](https://github.com/dudung/unegx), [x](https://dudung.github.io/x/), [xeqn](https://github.com/dudung/xeqn), and also others not related to GitHub as listed [here](https://dudung.github.io/text).

Then, I ask GPT-4o for advice and it suggests Bytes and Grains [^gpt4o_2024].
