Three stories to refer in the weekend<!--more-->

I admit that I am not be able as discipline as any other Medium writers, e.g. that can write a story a day for almost three years [^paul_2024], that can observe the amplification of too early coffee drinking in the cortisol level [^b_2024], or that can find selt motivation in making the wrting much more fun [^ucheagwu_2024].

To write a story a week is still hard for me and I might find one of the reason. It is the features or characteristics that a story must have, e.g. length, references, original examples, good image, link to, at least, one of my previous written stories, and maximum duration of writing about 2-3 hours. Those are good, but it limit myself in writing to often. When I can have those all, I do not write. It sound not good, right?

Today I try lower those constraints by writing first the story on my blog, bug ([bytes-und-grains](https://dudung.github.io/bug/)) and then port it to Medium. I hope it works.

Thanks to Mr. Plan ₿, Paul, and Chinyere Ucheagwu for the today inspirations.
