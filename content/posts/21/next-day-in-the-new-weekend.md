Continue to to build motivation for new weekend<!--more-->

It is now ~~0515~~ 0524 and this early morning about three hours ago the water container leake due to intermittens function of tank buoy. Two goals today are a user listed on [0003](../0003) and BRIN visit to FI, where the focus should be back to work on [graclussep2](https://github.com/dudung/graclussep2). The dean reminded me yesterday about habilitation for "the position". I should focus to the focus. Now it is 0530, update GitHub for this bug.
