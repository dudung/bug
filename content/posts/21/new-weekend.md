To build motivation for new weekend<!--more-->

It is now 0415 and still in the process of building up the motivation as in previous post [2107](../2017), which can not achieve a 10 mins read post. One item of today plan is to update users on [0003](../0003), that is still not updated from Friday, 16 Aug 2024. It is 0427 and still 1 min read, pause for nature call and subuh. Update GitHub.

`0543` Finish add IG link for users on [0003](../0003), C-uJGHKSgLd, C-tq0Jmys5E, and C-thFcISrss  of 16-aug-2024, but not the files for OSF. Update this post and also GitHub. The style is one direction of writing, with nearly no correction.
