Recreate the blog: Some features<!--more-->

Continuing previous post [^viridi_2024] here some features are presented, just as reminder.


## math
Roots of a quadratic equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ can be obtained

$$\tag{1}
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
$$

which is knonw as quadratic formula.
