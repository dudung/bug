To keep decayed motivation still exists<!--more-->

Actually I do not know what to write for `bug`. It is a common weekend where usually the inertia is at its biggest value. It requires some special forces to move from relaxing state to dynamic, moving state. This state is very uncomfortable, since I can not take a full rest for recovering but also can not think to continue some unfinished works. It seems that the processor has a blank state, where it can only process necessary activities only for surviving, but not for further stage than that.

I just let the finggers dance on the computer keyboard and the words flow not so meaningful. At least there are some quantity of thoughts but do not say about the quality.

Read books, write codes, derive equations, watch movies, work in the garden, and walk around track or neighborhood are some that I like to do, but not today. I just want to sleep and then to fresh for Monday routines. This writing is one of the way to get tired, so I can sleep with quality of recovery. I hope it works.

It is a one way writing flow without correction. Now is 0626 and there are only 1 min read. I do not know when it reaches 2 min read. It does right away, 0627 now. So it is getting better.

Suppose that my motivation is $M$
