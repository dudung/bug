Polynomial and its n-th derivative<!--more-->

Using limit n-th derivative of a polynomial function can be easily found [^colthrust_1998]. Some theorems, such as power rule, sum & different rule, and constant multiple rule, are required in finding the derivatives [^ai_2023]. Using derivative critical and inflection points of a polynomial function can be studied [^byrd_2011].

Here general formulas for a polynomial function and its n-th derivatives for $x=0$ are given.
