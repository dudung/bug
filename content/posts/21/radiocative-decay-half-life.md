Half-life of radioactive material<!--more-->

As result of nuclear instability, radioactivity refers to the particles which are emitted from nuclei, where The most common types of radiation are called alpha, beta, and gamma radiation [^nave_2024]. There is also other view of point that radioactivity is the act of emitting radiation spontaneously, where this is done by an atomic nucleus that, for some reason, is unstable, so it wants to give up some energy in order to shift to a more stable configuration [^denny_1997].
