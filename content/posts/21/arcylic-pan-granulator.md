+ It will be initial version, and will be andvanced where next support grant available.
+ Initial use is to study the behavior theoretically with meso-scale experiment using an analog computer.
+ Potential applications are study of granulator, heat transport, size distribution, impact measurement, mixing or segregation indices.
