Discussion triggered book finding<!--more-->

An information with age of about 3 hours listed in Google SERP showing the 2024 Nobel Prize lauretes [^nobel_2024]. The searching is triggered by discussion among Andriyan Bayu Suksmono, Acep Purqon, Faizal Rohmat, and others in several WhatsApp groups. It makes me itchy since I just know that development of ML is related to statistical physics. Dr. Purqon show a chapter with title "Chapter 8 Recurrent Networks Rooted in Statistical Physics", that I can not find the book. But I arrive at other book [^huang_2021]
