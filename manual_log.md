ERROR instagram shortcode: Missing config value for services.instagram.accessToken. This can be set in config.toml, but it is recommended to configure this via the HUGO_SERVICES_INSTAGRAM_ACCESSTOKEN OS environment variable. If you are using a Client Access Token, remember that you must combine it with your App ID using a pipe symbol (<APPID>|<CLIENTTOKEN>) otherwise the request will fail.
You can suppress this error by adding the following to your site configuration:
ignoreErrors = ['error-missing-instagram-accesstoken']
Built in 5378 ms
Error: error building site: logged 1 error(s)

--> Implement in the hugo.toml and it works
ignoreErrors = ['error-missing-instagram-accesstoken']
